= Reactive Streams with Quarkus and Kafka
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this exercise, you will use the Quarkus Kafka extension to build a streaming application using MicroProfile Reactive Streams Messaging and https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka^], a distributed streaming platform. You will also use https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/amq-streams-datasheet[Red Hat AMQ streams^], which provides an easy way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes and OpenShift using https://operatorhub.io/what-is-an-operator[Operators^].

== What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

* Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
* Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
* Process streams of records as they occur.

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

* Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
* Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

== What is AMQ Streams?

AMQ Streams simplifies the process of running Apache Kafka in an OpenShift cluster. AMQ Streams provides container images and Operators for running Kafka on OpenShift. AMQ Streams Operators are fundamental to the running of AMQ Streams. The Operators provided with AMQ Streams are purpose-built with specialist operational knowledge to effectively manage Kafka.

Operators simplify the process of:

* Deploying and running Kafka clusters
* Deploying and running Kafka components
* Configuring access to Kafka
* Securing access to Kafka
* Upgrading Kafka
* Managing brokers
* Creating and managing topics
* Creating and managing users

== The Goal

In this exercise, we are going to generate (random) names in one component. These names are written in a Kafka topic (`names`). A second component reads from the `names` Kafka topic and applies some magic conversion to the name (adding an honorific). The result is sent to an _in-memory stream_ consumed by a JAX-RS resource. The data is sent to a browser using https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/[_server-sent events_^] and displayed in the browser. It will look like this:

image::names.png[names,800]

=== Create Kafka Cluster

The Strimzi operator installs and manages Kafka clusters on Kubernetes. It's been pre-installed for you, so all you have to do is create a Kafka cluster inside your namespace.

First, on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project[Topology View^], click **+Add to Project** on the left. Then, Type in `Kafka` in the search box, and click on the *Kafka*:

image::fromcat-kafka.png[names,800]

These are all of the Kafka cluster elements you can install. Click on **Create**. This will open a yaml file for you to configure the cluster before it's installed. Change the name of the cluster from `my-cluster` to `names-cluster` (under the _metadata_ section of the YAML file). Leave all other values as-is, and click **Create**:

image::createkafka.png[createkafka,800]

This will create a new Kafka Kubernetes object in your namespace, triggering the Operator to deploy Kafka.

== Create Kafka Topic

Follow the same process to create a Kafka _Topic_:

Click **+Add to Project** on the left. Then, Type in `Topic` in the search box, and click on the *Create*:

image::createkafkatopic.png[createkafka,800]

We'll need to create a topic for our application to stream to and from, so in the YAML:

* Change the _metadata > name_ value from `my-topic` to `names`.
* Change the vale of the `strimzi.io/cluster=my-cluster` to `strimzi.io/cluster=names-cluster`

Then click **Create**.

image::topiccreate.png[topiccreate,800]

This will cause the Operator to provision a new Topic in the Kafka cluster.

Back on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project[Topology View^], make sure all the Kafka and Zookeeper pods are up and running (with dark blue circles):

image::kafkaup.png[topiccreate,800]

It may take a few minutes for all of the pods to appear spin up. You can continue to the next step while the Kafka cluster and topics are created.

== Add Quarkus Kafka Extension

With Kafka installing, turn your attention back to the app. Like other exercises, we'll need another extension to integrate with Kafka. Install it with:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="messaging-kafka" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs
----

You should see:

[source,console]
----
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka has been installed
----

This will add the necessary entries in your `pom.xml` to bring in the Kafka extension.

== The Application You Will Build

The app consists of 3 components that pass messages via Kafka and an in-memory stream, then uses SSE to push messages to the browser. It looks like:

image::kafkaarch.png[kafka, 800]

== Create name generator

To start building the app, create a new Java class file in the `org.acme.people.stream` called `NameGenerator.java`. This class will generate random names and publish them to our Kafka topic for further processing. Use this code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.stream;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.acme.people.utils.CuteNameGenerator;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;

import java.time.Duration;

@ApplicationScoped
public class NameGenerator {

    @Outgoing("generated-name")        // <1>
    public Multi<String> generate() {  // <2>  
        return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                .onOverflow().drop()
                .map(tick -> CuteNameGenerator.generate());
    }

}
----
<1> Instruct Reactive Messaging to dispatch the items from returned stream to `generated-name`
<2> The method returns Reactive Stream emitting a random name every 5 seconds

The method returns a Reactive Stream. The generated items are sent to the stream named `generated-name`. This stream is mapped to Kafka using the application.properties file that we will create soon.

== Add honorifics

The name converter reads the names from Kafka, and transforms them, adding a random (English) honorific to the beginning of the name.

Create a new Java class file in the same package called `NameConverter.java`. Use this code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.stream;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Broadcast;

@ApplicationScoped
public class NameConverter {

    private static final String[] honorifics = {"Mr.", "Mrs.", "Sir", "Madam", "Lord", "Lady", "Dr.", "Professor", "Vice-Chancellor", "Regent", "Provost", "Prefect"};

    @Incoming("names")               // <1>
    @Outgoing("my-data-stream")      // <2>
    @Broadcast                       // <3>
    public String process(String name) {
        String honorific = honorifics[(int)Math.floor(Math.random() * honorifics.length)];
        return honorific + " " + name;
    }
}
----
<1> Indicates that the method consumes the items from the `names` topic
<2> Indicates that the objects returned by the method are sent to the `my-data-stream` stream
<3> Indicates that the item are dispatched to all _subscribers_

The process method is called for every Kafka record from the `names` topic (configured in the application configuration). Every result is sent to the my-data-stream in-memory stream.

== Expose to front end

Finally, let’s bind our stream to a JAX-RS resource. Create a new Java class in the same package called `NameResource.java`. Use this code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.stream;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

/**
 * A simple resource retrieving the in-memory "my-data-stream" and sending the items as server-sent events.
 */
@Path("/names")
public class NameResource {

    @Inject
    @Channel("my-data-stream") Publisher<String> names; // <1>

    @GET
    @Path("/stream")
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)// <2>
    public Publisher<String> stream() { // <3>
        return names;
    }
}
----
<1> Injects the `my-data-stream` stream using the `@Channel` qualifier
<2> Indicates that the content is sent using _Server Sent Events_
<3> Returns the stream (Reactive Stream)

[NOTE]
====
There is a pre-created `names.html` page for you to use (in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` directory) which will make a request to this `/names/stream` endpoint using standard JavaScript running in the browser and draw the resulting names using the https://d3js.org/[D3.js library^]. The JavaScript that makes this call looks like this (do not copy this into anything!):

[source,javascript]
----
var source = new EventSource("/names/stream"); // <1>

source.onmessage = function (event) { // <2>

    console.log("received new name: " + event.data);
    // process new name in event.data
    // ...

    // update the display with the new name
    update(); // <3>
};
----
<1> Uses your browser's support for the `EventSource` API (part of the W3C SSE standard) to call the endpoint
<2> Each time a message is received via SSE, _react_ to it by running this function
<3> Refresh the display using the D3.js library

====

== Configure application

We need to configure the Kafka connector. This is done in the `application.properties` file (in the `src/main/resources` directory). The keys are structured as follows:

`mp.messaging.[outgoing|incoming].{channel-name}.property=value`

The `channel-name` segment must match the value set in the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotation:

* `generated-name` → sink to which we write the names
* `names` → source from which we read the names

Add the following values to the app's `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source,none,role="copypaste"]
----
# Configure the Kafka sink (we write to it)
%prod.mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-name.bootstrap.servers=names-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092<1>
%prod.mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-name.connector=smallrye-kafka
%prod.mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-name.topic=names
%prod.mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-name.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

# Configure the Kafka source (we read from it)
%prod.mp.messaging.incoming.names.bootstrap.servers=names-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092<1>
%prod.mp.messaging.incoming.names.connector=smallrye-kafka
%prod.mp.messaging.incoming.names.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
----
<1> The hostnames you see here will only make sense (be resolvable via DNS) when this app is run in the same Kubernetes namespace as the Kafka cluster you created earlier. So you'll see this and other config values above prefixed with `%prod` which will not try to initialize Kafka when in `dev` mode.

More details about this configuration is available on the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Producer configuration] and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[Consumer configuration^] section from the Kafka documentation.

[NOTE]
====
What about `my-data-stream`? This is an in-memory stream, not connected to a message broker.
====

== Rebuild and redeploy app to OpenShift

Run the following command which will build and deploy using the OpenShift extension:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs && \
oc label dc/people app.kubernetes.io/part-of=people --overwrite && \
oc label dc/postgres-database app.kubernetes.io/part-of=people --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/people app.openshift.io/connects-to=postgres-database --overwrite && \
oc rollout status -w dc/people
----

The build should take a minute or two to complete.

== Test

Our application should be up and running in a few seconds after the build completes and generating names. To see if it's working, access the http://people-{{USER_ID}}-project.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/names.html[graphical name cloud powered by Quarkus, MicroProfile and Kafka^]. You should see a cloud of names updating every 5 seconds (it may take a few seconds for it to start!):

[NOTE]
====
It takes a few seconds to establish the connection to Kafka. If you don't see new names generated every 5 seconds, reload the browser page to re-initialize the SSE stream.
====

image::names.png[names,800]

These are the original names streamed through Kafka, altered to add a random honorific like *Sir* or *Madam*, and displayed in a *word cloud* for you to enjoy!

== Congratulations!

This guide has shown how you can interact with Kafka using Quarkus. It utilizes MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to build data streaming applications.

If you want to go further check the documentation of https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging[SmallRye Reactive Messaging^], the implementation used in Quarkus.
