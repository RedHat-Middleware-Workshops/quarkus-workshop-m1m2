In this step, you will create a straightforward application serving a `hello` endpoint. To demonstrate dependency injection this endpoint uses a `greeting` bean.

This IDE is based on Eclipse Che (which is in turn based on MicroSoft VS Code editor).

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

## Import Project

Let's import our project. Click on **Clone Repository** (or type kbd:[F1], enter 'git' and click on the auto-completed _Git Clone.._ )

image::che-workspace-gitclone.png[cdw, 900]

Step through the prompts, using the following value for **Repository URL**. If you use *FireFox*, it may end up pasting extra spaces at the end, so just press backspace after pasting:

[source,none,role="copypaste"]
----
https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs
----

image::crw-clone-repo.png[crw,900]

Ensure `projects/` is selected, then click on *Select Repository Location* then click on *Open*:

image::crw-add-workspace-2.png[crw, 900]

Note that you probably need to reload your web browser to load the new workspace.

The project is imported into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer (collapse the *OPEN EDITORS*):

image::crw-clone-explorer.png[crw,900]

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a
terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

image::cmd-terminal.png[codeready-workspace-terminal, 700]
====

==== IMPORTANT: Check out proper Git branch

To make sure you're using the right version of the project files, run this command in a CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs && git checkout ocp-4.10
----

The project has

* The Maven structure
* An `org.acme.people.rest.GreetingResource` resource exposed on `/hello`, along with a simple test
* A landing page that is accessible on `http://localhost:8080` after starting the application
* The application configuration file
* Other source files we'll use later

Navigate to `src -> main -> java -> org.acme.people.rest` in the project tree and double click on `GreetingResource.java`.

image::initnav.png[codeready-workspace-terminal, 800]

This class has a very simple RESTful endpoint definition:

[source, java]
----
@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

It’s a very simple REST endpoint, returning "hello" to requests on `/hello`.

[NOTE]
====
Compared to vanilla JAX-RS, with Quarkus there is no need to create an `Application` class. It’s supported but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different `Scoped` annotations (`ApplicationScoped`, `RequestScoped`, etc).
====

## Running the Application in Live Coding Mode

**Live Coding** (also referred to as _dev mode_) allows us to run the app and make changes on the fly. Quarkus will automatically re-compile and reload the app when changes are made. This is a powerful and efficient style of developing that you will use throughout the lab.

You can always use the `mvn` (Maven) commands to run Quarkus apps, but we've created a few helpful shortcuts on the right to run various Maven commands.

Start the app by clicking on _Live Coding_:

image::cmd-livecoding.png[livecoding, 700]

This will compile and run the app using `mvn compile quarkus:dev` in a Terminal window. Leave this terminal window open throughout the lab! You will complete the entire lab without shutting down Quarkus Live Coding mode, so be careful not to close the tab (if you do, you re-run it). This is very useful for quick experimentation.

[NOTE]
====
The first time you build the app, new dependencies may be downloaded via maven. This should only happen once, after that things will go even faster
====

[NOTE]
====
You may see WARNINGs like `Unrecognized configuration key` or `Duplicate entry`. These are configuration values that will take effect later on and can be safely ignored for now.
====

You should see:

[source,none]
----
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) people 1.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.2.3.Final-redhat-00013) started in 8.393s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated.
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Installed features: [cdi, resteasy-reactive, smallrye-context-propagation]

--
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----

Note the amazingly fast startup time! The app is now running *locally* (within the Che container in which the workspace is also running). `localhost` refers to the Kubernetes pod, not *your* laptop (so therefore opening localhost:8080 in your browser will not do anything).

You can also see *Tests paused* by default when a Quarkus application gets started. We will learn more details in the _Testing Quarkus App_ lab.

CodeReady will also detect that the Quarkus app opens port `5005` (for debugging) and `8080` (for web requests). *Do not open port 5005*, but when prompted, *open the port `8080`*, which opens a small web browser in CodeReady:

image::open-port.png[port, 700]

You should see the default Quarkus welcome page (you may need to click the _reload_ icon):

image::welcome-quarkus.png[port, 900]

Open a *new* CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

image::cmd-terminal.png[livecoding, 900]

and invoke the `hello` endpoint using the following _curl_ command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
----

You can also click on the URL link at the upper right to open the same default page in a separate browser tab:

image::crw-open-page.png[page, 800]

Add `/hello` in your browser to see the same result as the _curl_ command:

image::crw-open-page-hello.png[page, 800]

Now, let's exercise the **live reload** capabilities of Quarkus. In CodeReady, open the `GreetingResource.java` file (in `src/main/java/org/acme/people/rest`) and change `return "hello";` to `return "hola";` in the editor. After making this change, reload the same brower tab that was showing `hello`. It should now show `hola`.

Wow, how cool is that? Supersonic Subatomic live reload! Go ahead and change it a few more times and access the endpoint again. And we're just getting started. Leave the app running so we can continue to change it on the fly in the next section.

[NOTE]
====
`quarkus:dev` runs Quarkus in development mode. This enables live reload with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.
====

[NOTE]
====
This will also listen for a debugger on port `5005`. If you want to wait for the debugger to attach before running you can pass `-Ddebug` on the command line. If you don’t want the debugger at all you can use `-Ddebug=false`. We'll use this later.
====

### Package the app

Quarkus apps can be packaged as an executable JAR file or a native binary. We'll cover native binaries later, so for now, let's package as an executable JAR.

Click on `Package app for OpenShift`:

image::cmd-package.png[livecoding, 700]

This produces an executable jar file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory:

image::jar.png[jar,800]

* `quarkus-run.jar` - being an executable fast jar. Be aware that it’s not an über-jar as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

## Run the executable JAR

Run the packaged application. In a Terminal, run the following command:

[source, sh, role="copypaste"]
----
java -Dquarkus.http.port=8081 -jar $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

[NOTE]
====
We use `-Dquarkus.http.port=8081` to avoid conflicting with port `8080` used for Live Coding mode
====

Click on `Yes` to make 8081 port available then click on `x` not to open link.

image::popup_8081.png[port_8081,800]

With the app running, open a separate terminal window, and ensure the app _is_ running by executing a `curl` command:

[source, sh, role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/hello
----

You should see:

```console
hola
```

## Cleanup

Go back to the terminal in which you ran the app with `java -jar` and stop the app by pressing kbd:[CTRL+C]. **Be sure not to close the "Live Coding" terminal!**

## Congratulations!

You've seen how to build a basic app, package it as an executable JAR and start it up very quickly. The JAR file can be used like any other executable JAR file (e.g. running it as-is, packaging as a Linux container, etc.)

In the next step we'll inject a custom bean to showcase Quarkus' CDI capabilities.
