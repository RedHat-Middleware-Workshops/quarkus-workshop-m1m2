= Hibernate ORM with Panache
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

Hibernate ORM is the de facto JPA implementation and offers you the full breadth of an Object Relational Mapper. It makes complex mappings possible, but many simple and common mappings can also be complex. Hibernate ORM with https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache[*Panache*^] focuses on making your entities trivial and fun to write and use with Quarkus.

With Panache, we took an opinionated approach to make hibernate as easy as possible. Hibernate ORM with Panache offers the following:

* Auto-generation of IDs (but you can still customize if needed)
* No need for getters/setters. You simply refer to fields directly like `person.name` instead of `person.getName()`. You can still create getters and setters if you need to!
* Lots of super-useful static methods for access like `listAll()`, `find()`, etc.
* No need for custom queries for basic operations, e.g. `Person.find("name", "stef")`

That’s all there is to it: with Panache, Hibernate ORM has never looked so trim and neat.

== People

You may have wondered why we are using `people` in our Java APIs, and now you'll find out; we'll be creating a simple data-driven application that manages a set of people, who have a name, birth date, and eye color. In the previous lab we added the extension for Panache to our project, but we will need a few more for connecting to databases. Add these extensions with the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="hibernate-orm-panache, jdbc-h2, jdbc-postgresql" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs
----

You should see:

[source,console]
----
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache has been installed
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-h2 has been installed
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql has been installed
----

We'll use the in-memory H2 database for local testing, and Postgres when we deploy to our production Kubernetes environment. So that's why we have added in the `h2` and `postgresql` extensions. `resteasy-reactive-jackson` is used to encode JSON objects.

The database connection details (JDBC url, database credentials) are specified in `application.properties` using the Quarkus Profile support. So for example you'll find this:

[source,none]
----
%prod.quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql
%prod.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres-database/person
%prod.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.driver=org.postgresql.Driver

%dev.quarkus.datasource.db-kind=h2
%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:mem:person
%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.driver=org.h2.Driver

%test.quarkus.datasource.db-kind=h2
%test.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:mem:person
%test.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.driver=org.h2.Driver
----

This causes the `%dev` properties (using H2 database) to be active in development (and the `%test` in test mode), and the `%prod` properties (using Postgres) to be used when in production (not in dev or test).

[NOTE]
====
These names are known to Quarkus, and you can introduce your own profiles and use them in a similar way for other environments (and can be overridden at runtime). You can read more about externalized config in the https://quarkus.io/guides/application-configuration-guide[Quarkus Application Configuration Guide^].
====

== Create Entity

With our extension installed, we can now define our entity using Panache.

We'll first need the definition of eye colors, so let's create an `enum`. Create a new java class file in `src/main/java/org/acme/people/model` called `EyeColor.java`, and replace the following enum definition:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.model;

public enum EyeColor {
    BLUE, GREEN, HAZEL, BROWN
}
----

This app will be a database of people, each of which have a name, birthdate, and eye color. We'll need an entity, so open up the `src/main/java/org/acme/people/model/Person.java` file, and **replace** the stub code in the file with the following:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.model;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.EnumType;
import javax.persistence.Enumerated;

import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheEntity;

import org.acme.people.model.EyeColor;

@Entity
public class Person extends PanacheEntity {
    // the person's name
    public String name;

    // the person's birthdate
    public LocalDate birth;

    // the person's eye color
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    @Column(length = 8)
    public EyeColor eyes;

    // TODO: Add more queries
}
----

[NOTE]
====
You will incrementally replace the `// TODO` elements as we go along, so don't delete them just yet!
====

[NOTE]
====
Extending `PanacheEntity` is referred to as the https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache#solution-1-using-the-active-record-pattern[Active Record Pattern^]. There is also another pattern called the https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache#solution-2-using-the-repository-pattern[Repository Pattern^] that you could use which involves separating your entities from the operations on those entities.
====

As you can see we've defined the three fields `name`, `birth`, and `eyes`. We're using the Java Persistence API's `@Enumerated` field type for our eye color.

== Define RESTful endpoint

Next, we'll create a `PersonResource` class which we will use for our RESTful endpoint. Create a new Java class in the `src/main/java/org/acme/people/rest` directory called `PersonResource.java` with the following code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people.rest;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;
import javax.transaction.Transactional;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.QueryParam;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import org.acme.people.model.DataTable;
import org.acme.people.model.EyeColor;
import org.acme.people.model.Person;
import org.acme.people.utils.CuteNameGenerator;

import io.quarkus.panache.common.Parameters;
import io.quarkus.runtime.StartupEvent;
import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheQuery;

@Path("/person")
@ApplicationScoped
public class PersonResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public List<Person> getAll() {
        return Person.listAll();
    }

    // TODO: add basic queries

    // TODO: add datatable query

    // TODO: Add lifecycle hook

}
----

[NOTE]
====
You may see lots of warnings about unused imports. Ignore them, we'll use them later!
====

As you can see we've implemented our first Panache-based query, the `getAll` method, which will return our list of people as a JSON object when we access the `GET /person` endpoint. This is defined using standard JAX-RS `@Path` and `@GET` and `@Produces` annotations.

== Add sample data

Let's add some sample data to the database so we can test things out. Create a new file `src/main/resources/import.sql` and add some SQL statements to the file to run on startup:

Add these lines to `import.sql` file you just created:

[source,sql,role="copypaste"]
----
INSERT INTO person(id, name, birth, eyes) VALUES (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), 'Farid Ulyanov', to_date('1974-08-15', 'YYYY-MM-dd'), 'BLUE');
INSERT INTO person(id, name, birth, eyes) VALUES (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), 'Salvador L. Witcher', to_date('1984-05-24', 'YYYY-MM-dd'), 'BROWN');
INSERT INTO person(id, name, birth, eyes) VALUES (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), 'Kim Hu', to_date('1999-04-25', 'YYYY-MM-dd'), 'HAZEL');
----

These statements will add some fake people to our database on startup.

== Test the app

With the app running, let's try out our first RESTful endpoint to retrieve all the sample users. Open up a separate Terminal and issue the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8080/person | jq
----

We call the endpoint with `curl` then send the output through `jq` to make the output prettier. You should see:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "birth": "1974-08-15",
    "eyes": "BLUE",
    "name": "Farid Ulyanov"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "birth": "1984-05-24",
    "eyes": "BROWN",
    "name": "Salvador L. Witcher"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "birth": "1999-04-25",
    "eyes": "HAZEL",
    "name": "Kim Hu"
  }
]
----

It's working! Note that the `id` field was added to our entity, but never appear in our query APIs and can be safely ignored most of the time.

[NOTE]
====
Advanced use cases may require a custom ID strategy, which can by done by extending `PanacheEntityBase` instead of `PanacheEntity`, and declaring a public `id` field with the necessary policy. For example (do not copy this code into your app):

[source,java]
----
@Id
@SequenceGenerator(
          name = "personSequence",
          sequenceName = "person_id_seq",
          allocationSize = 1,
          initialValue = 4)
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "personSequence")
public Integer id;
----
====

== Add Basic Queries

Let’s modify the application and add some queries. Much like traditional object-oriented programming, Panache and Quarkus recommend you place your custom entity queries as close to the entity definition as possible, in this case in the entity definition itself. Open the `Person` entity class (it's in the `org.acme.person.model` package), and add the following code under the `// TODO: Add more queries` comment:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    public static List<Person> findByColor(EyeColor color) {
        return list("eyes", color);
    }

    public static List<Person> getBeforeYear(int year) {
        return Person.<Person>streamAll()
        .filter(p -> p.birth.getYear() <= year)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
----

These two queries will find a list of people in our database based on eye color, or birth year. Note the `getBeforeYear` is implemented using the Java Streams API.

[NOTE]
====
All list methods in Panache-based entities (those that extend from `PanacheEntity`) have equivalent stream versions. So `list` has a `stream` variant, `listAll`-->`streamAll` and so on.
====

With our custom entity queries implemented in our `Person` entity class, let's add RESTful endpoints to `PersonResource` to access them.

Open the `PersonResource` class and add two news endpoint under the `//TODO: add basic queries` comment:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @GET
    @Path("/eyes/{color}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public List<Person> findByColor(@PathParam(value = "color") EyeColor color) {
        return Person.findByColor(color);
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/birth/before/{year}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public List<Person> getBeforeYear(@PathParam(value = "year") int year) {
        return Person.getBeforeYear(year);
    }
----

== Inspect the results

Check that it works as expected by testing the new endpoints. Let's find all the people with `BLUE` eyes. Execute in your Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8080/person/eyes/BLUE | jq
----

You should only see **one** person with BLUE eyes:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "birth": "1974-08-15",
    "eyes": "BLUE",
    "name": "Farid Ulyanov"
  }
]
----

And let's find people born in 1990 or earlier:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8080/person/birth/before/1990 | jq
----

You should see **two** people born in 1990 or earlier:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Farid Ulyanov",
    "birth": "1974-08-15",
    "eyes": "BLUE"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Salvador L. Witcher",
    "birth": "1984-05-24",
    "eyes": "BROWN"
  }
]
----

The `Person` entity's superclass comes with lots of super useful static methods and you can add your own in your entity class. Users can just start using your entity `Person` by typing `Person`, and getting completion for all the operations in a single place.

== Add Paging and Filtering

In the previous step you added a few more custom queries to your entity and the associated RESTful endpoints. In this step we'll build a slightly more complex query including filtering, searching and paging capabilities.

=== Showing data in tables

Earlier we used `curl` to access our data, which is very useful for testing, but for real applications you will usually surface the data in other ways, like on web pages using tables, with options for searching, sorting, filtering, paging, etc. Quarkus and Panache make this easy to adapt your application for any display library or framework.

Let's use a popular jQuery-based plugin called https://www.datatables.net[DataTables^]. It features a *server-side* processing mode where it depends on the server (in this case our Quarkus app) to do searching, filtering, sorting, and paging. This is useful for very large datasets, on the order of hundreds of thousands of records or more. Transmitting the entire data set to the client browser is inefficient at best, and will crash browsers, increase networking usage, and frustrate users at worst. So let's just return the exact data needed to be shown.

=== Add Datatables endpoint

https://www.datatables.net/manual/server-side[DataTables documentation^] shows that its frontend will call an endpoint on the backend to retrieve some amount of data. It will pass several query parameters to tell the server what to sort, filter, search, and which data to return based on the page size and current page the user is viewing. For this example, we'll only support a subset:

* `start` - The index of the first element needed
* `length` - Total number records to return (or less, if there are less records that meet criteria)
* `search[value]` - The value of the search box
* `draw` - DataTables does asnychronous processing, so this value is sent with each request, expecting it to be returned as-is, so DataTables can piece things back together on the frontend if a user clicks things quickly.

Open the `PersonResource` resource class and add the following code below the `// TODO: add datatable query` comment:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @GET
    @Path("/datatable")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public DataTable datatable(
        @QueryParam(value = "draw") int draw,
        @QueryParam(value = "start") int start,
        @QueryParam(value = "length") int length,
        @QueryParam(value = "search[value]") String searchVal

        ) {
            // TODO: Begin result

            // TODO: Filter based on search

            // TODO: Page and return

    }
----

[NOTE]
====
You will see syntax errors highlighted in the editor when you paste the code. We'll fix those in the next step!
====

Here we are using JAX-RS `@QueryParam` values to specify the incoming parameters and be able to use them when the frontend calls the `GET /person/datatable` endpoint.

We'll fill in the `TODO` comments to build this method.

=== Implement `/datatable` endpoint

DataTables requires a specific JSON payload to be returned from this, and we've pre-created a POJO `DataTable` class representing this structure in `src/main/java/org/acme/people/model/DataTable.java`. This simple structure includes these fields:

* `draw` - The async processing record id
* `recordsTotal` - Total records in database
* `recordsFiltered` - Total records that match filtering criteria
* `data` - The actual array of records
* `error` - Error string, if any

So, in our `PersonResource` endpoint, we'll start with an empty `result` object using the pre-created `DataTable` model. Add this code below the `// TODO: Begin Result` comment:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
            DataTable result = new DataTable();
            result.setDraw(draw); // <1>
----
<1> We initialize the `DataTable` return object with the value passed in, to ensure DataTables redraws in the correct order in case of async returns.

=== Implement search logic

Next, if the request includes a search parameter, let's take care of that by including a search query, otherwise just collect all records. Add this code below the `// TODO: Filter based on search` marker:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
            PanacheQuery<Person> filteredPeople;

            if (searchVal != null && !searchVal.isEmpty()) { // <1>
                filteredPeople = Person.<Person>find("name like :search",
                    Parameters.with("search", "%" + searchVal + "%"));
            } else {
                filteredPeople = Person.findAll();
            }
----
<1> If a search value was passed in, use it to search using the Panache `find` method. Otherwise, use `findAll` to skip filtering.

=== Implement paging logic

And finally, we use the built-in Panache `page` operator to seek to the correct page of records and stream the number of entries desired, set the values into the `result` and return it. Add this code below the `// TODO: Page and return` marker:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
            int page_number = start / length;
            filteredPeople.page(page_number, length);

            result.setRecordsFiltered(filteredPeople.count());
            result.setData(filteredPeople.list());
            result.setRecordsTotal(Person.count());

            return result;
----

=== Test the result

Let's test out our new endpoint using `curl` to search for names with `yan` in their name. Execute this in the Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/person/datatable?draw=1&start=0&length=10&search\[value\]=yan" | jq
----

This should return a single entity (since in our 3-person sample data, only one has `yan` in their name), embedded in the return object that DataTable is expecting (with the `draw`, `recordsFiltered`, `recordsTotal` etc):

[source,json]
----
{
  "draw": 1,
  "recordsTotal": 3,
  "recordsFiltered": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Farid Ulyanov",
      "birth": "1974-08-15",
      "eyes": "BLUE"
    }
  ],
  "error": null
}
----

The `data`, `draw`, `recordsFiltered` and `recordsTotal` values are what the DataTables frontend will be expecting when it calls this endpoint.

=== Add lifecycle hook

You often need to execute custom actions when the application starts and clean up everything when the application stops. In this case we'll add an action that will pre-generate a lot of fake data.

Managed beans (like our `PersonResource`) can listen for lifecycle events by using the `@Observes` annotation on method signatures, which will be called when the associated event occurs.

Open the `PersonResource` resource class and add the following lifecycle listener at the `// TODO: Add lifecycle hook` marker:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
    @Transactional
    void onStart(@Observes StartupEvent ev) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            String name = CuteNameGenerator.generate();
            LocalDate birth = LocalDate.now().plusWeeks(Math.round(Math.floor(Math.random() * 40 * 52 * -1)));
            EyeColor color = EyeColor.values()[(int)(Math.floor(Math.random() * EyeColor.values().length))];
            Person p = new Person();
            p.birth = birth;
            p.eyes = color;
            p.name = name;
            Person.persist(p);
        }
    }
----

This code will insert 1,000 fake people with random birthdates in the last 40 years, eye colors, and names at startup. Note the use of the `@Transactional` annotation - this is required for methods that make changes to the underlying database (and automatically executes the method in a Transaction for you).

=== Access new data

Although our lifecycle code is listening for `StartupEvent`, and our application has already started, in `quarkus:dev` mode Quarkus will still fire this event once. So let's test it out and see if it picks up our new data. We'll search for a single letter `F` and limit the results to `2`:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/person/datatable?draw=1&start=0&length=2&search\[value\]=F" | jq
----

[NOTE]
====
Adding 1k entries will make startup time artificially high, around 1 second.
====

You should get up to 2 records returned (since we passed `length=2` in the query), but the total number available should show many more indicating our search found many more, and the total number of records should now be `1003` (the 1k we added plus the 3 original values):

[source, json]
----
{
  "draw": 1,
  "recordsTotal": 1003,
  "recordsFiltered": 140, // <1>
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Farid Ulyanov",
      "birth": "1974-08-15",
      "eyes": "BLUE"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "name": "Crimson Ferret",
      "birth": "1988-03-10",
      "eyes": "BROWN"
    }
  ],
  "error": null
}
----
<1> Note the values for `recordsFiltered` (the number of records with the letter `F` in the name), and `recordsTotal`. The value you see for `recordsFiltered` may be different than the above value, since the number of records with an `F` in the name may vary since the data is random. But the `recordsTotal` shows our initial 3 values, plus the 1000 additional values we added in the lifecycle hook code.

== Deploy to OpenShift

Our production environment needs a "real" database so let's deploy a Postgres database to OpenShift. Back in the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project[Topology View^], click **+Add to Project** on the left. Then, Type in `PostgreSQL (Ephemeral)` in the search box, and click on the *PostgreSQL (ephemeral)*:

image::db.png[db, 700]

Click on *Instantiate Template* and fill in the following fields, leaving the others as their default values:

* **Namespace** (the first one): Select `{{ USER_ID }}-project`
* **Namespace** (the _second_ one): `openshift`
* **Database Service Name**: `postgres-database`
* **PostgreSQL Connection Username**: `sa`
* **PostgreSQL Connection Password**: `sa`
* **PostgreSQL Database Name**: `person`

image::db-postgres-values.png[db, 700]

Click *Create*.

And label the items with proper icons:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc label dc/postgres-database  app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite && \
oc label dc/people app.kubernetes.io/part-of=people --overwrite && \
oc label dc/postgres-database app.kubernetes.io/part-of=people --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/people app.openshift.io/connects-to=postgres-database --overwrite
----

This will deploy the database to our new project. Click on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project[Topology View^] to see it:

image::database-deployment.png[inventory_db_deployments, 700]

== Rebuild and redeploy app

In previous steps we deployed our sample application as a native binary. Now let's switch to a JVM-based deployment from here on out.

Now let's deploy the application itself. Run the following command which will build and deploy using the OpenShift extension:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete bc/people && \
mvn clean package -DskipTests -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs
----

The output should end with `BUILD SUCCESS`.

Finally, make sure it's actually done rolling out:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc rollout status -w dc/people
----

Wait for that command to report *replication controller _people-xx_ successfully rolled out* before continuing.

And let's do again to label the items with proper icons:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc label dc/people app.kubernetes.io/part-of=people --overwrite && \
oc label dc/postgres-database app.kubernetes.io/part-of=people --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/people app.openshift.io/connects-to=postgres-database --overwrite
----

Back on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-project[Topology View^], make sure it's done deploying (dark blue circle):

[NOTE]
====
Remember in our `application.properties` we have pre-defined database connections for the `%prod` profile. When Quarkus runs in production, it will connect to the database you just deployed!
====

image::database-redeployment.png[inventory_db_deployments, 700]

== Access deployed app

Now that we have our app running on OpenShift, let's see what we can do.

We can access using `curl` once again to find everyone born in or before the year 2000 (there will be many).

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s $(oc get route people -o=go-template --template={% raw %}'{{ .spec.host }}'{% endraw %})/person/birth/before/2000 | jq
----

Now access the http://people-{{USER_ID}}-project.{{ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}/datatable.html[graphical person browser powered by the DataTables library^]. It should look like:

image::datatable.png[datatable,800]

Notice the total number of records reported at the bottom. Type in a single letter, e.g. `F` in the search box and see how responsive the app is. Type additional letters to narrow the search. Rather than having all records loaded in the browser, DataTable makes a call back to our `/person/datatable` REST endpoint to fetch only those records that should be shown, based on page size, current page you're looking at, and any search filters. With a page size of `10` each REST call will only return up to 10 records, no matter how many there are in the database.

Skip around a few pages, try some different searches, and notice that the data is only loaded when needed. The overall performance is very good even for low-bandwidth connections or huge data sets.

== Congratulations
