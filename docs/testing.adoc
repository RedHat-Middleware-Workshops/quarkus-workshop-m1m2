Quarkus supports continuous testing, where tests run immediately after code changes have been saved. This allows you to get instant feedback on your code changes. Quarkus detects which tests cover which code, and uses this information to only run the relevant tests when code is changed.

In this step we'll show you how to effectively write functional and continuous testing for your Quarkus Apps. You should already have a completed test written for you, including the correct `pom.xml` setup where you should see 2 test dependencies:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

`quarkus-junit5` is required for testing, as it provides the `@QuarkusTest` annotation that controls the testing framework. `rest-assured` is not required but is a convenient way to test HTTP endpoints, we also provide integration that automatically sets the correct URL so no configuration is required.

The basic test is in the `GreetingResourceTest` (in the `src/test/java/org/acme/people` directory). For example:

[source, java]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class GreetingResourceTest {
    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
          .when().get("/hello")
          .then()
             .statusCode(200)
             .body(is("hello"));
    }
}
----

[WARNING]
====
When creating new tests, always double-check to be sure you are in the `src/test` directory tree, not `src/main`!

====

== Starting Continuous Testing

Go back to the terminal and go down the bottom of the screen you should see the following:

image::ct-resume.png[testshere, 800]

Press `r` and the continuous testing will start running. You should see the status change down the bottom of the screen as they are running, and it should finish with the following error:

image::ct-error.png[testshere, 800]

Note that you don't need to make _8081_ port available so close the popup window.

image::ct-8081-popup.png[testshere, 800]

This is because you changed the greeting in an earlier step. In `GreetingResource`, change `hola` back to `hello` (in the `GreetingResource` class) and the tests will run again automatically. Confirm all tests pass in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
INFO  [io.qua.test] (Test runner thread) All tests are now passing


--
All 1 test is passing (0 skipped), 1 test was run in 2600ms. Tests completed at 03:10:51 due to changes to GreetingResource.class.
Press [r] to re-run, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----

Add a new test in the existing `GreetingResourceTest.java` class under the `// add more tests` marker that tests the `/hello/greeting` endpoint by copying this code below the existing test:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Test
    public void testGreetingEndpoint() {
        String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        given()
          .pathParam("name", uuid)
          .when().get("/hello/greeting/{name}")
          .then()
            .statusCode(200)
            .body(startsWith("hello " + uuid));
    }
----

You will see new test result instantly in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
--
All 2 tests are passing (0 skipped), 2 tests were run in 1610ms. Tests completed at 03:12:56 due to changes to GreetingResource.class and 1 other files.
Press [r] to re-run, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----

== Controlling Continuous Testing

There are various hotkeys you can use to control continuous testing. Pressing `h` will display the following list of commands in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
== Continuous Testing

[r] - Re-run all tests
[f] - Re-run failed tests
[b] - Toggle 'broken only' mode, where only failing tests are run (disabled)
[v] - Print failures from the last test run
[p] - Pause tests
[o] - Toggle test output (disabled)
----

Quarkus also provides a new experimental Dev UI, which is available in dev mode (when you start quarkus with mvn quarkus:dev) at `/q/dev` by default. It allows you to quickly visualize all the extensions currently loaded, see their status and go directly to their documentation.

Click on `quarkus-devui` endpoint:

image::devui-endpoint.png[devui-endpoint, 700]

A new web browser will open automatically then it will show you something like this:

image::quarkus-devui.png[devui-endpoint, 800]

As you see, `All tests passed` on the right bottom. When you click on `Open` on the left bottom, it will show the Quarkus runtime logs:

image::quarkus-devui-open.png[devui-endpoint, 800]

Click on `Test results` then it will show the details of the test results:

image::quarkus-devui-test-result.png[devui-endpoint, 800]

== Injecting a URI

It is also possible to directly inject the URL into the test which can make it easy to use a different client. This is done via the `@TestHTTPResource` annotation.

Let’s write a simple test that shows this off to load some static resources. First create a simple HTML file in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/`. Right-click on this directory and select _New -> File_. Name the file `test.html` in the dialog box:

image::createhtml.png[html,700]
image::createhtml2.png[html,500]

Add this code to the file:

[source,html,role="copypaste"]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Testing with Quarkus</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>... it's fun and entertaining!</p>
</body>
</html>
----
Our test will verify that the `<title>` tags contain the right content.

Next, create a new test under `src/test/java` in the `org.acme.people` package called `StaticContentTest.java`. Replace this code to the file:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URL;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import io.quarkus.test.common.http.TestHTTPResource;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;

@QuarkusTest
public class StaticContentTest {

    @TestHTTPResource("test.html") // <1>
    URL url;

    @Test
    public void testIndexHtml() throws Exception {
        try (InputStream in = url.openStream()) {
            String contents = readStream(in);
            Assertions.assertTrue(contents.contains("<title>Testing with Quarkus</title>"));
        }
    }

    private static String readStream(InputStream in) throws IOException {
        byte[] data = new byte[1024];
        int r;
        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        while ((r = in.read(data)) > 0) {
            out.write(data, 0, r);
        }
        return new String(out.toByteArray(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }
}
----
<1> The `@TestHTTPResource` annotation allows you to directly inject the URL of the Quarkus instance, the value of the annotation will be the path component of the URL. For now `@TestHTTPResource` allows you to inject URI, URL and String representations of the URL.

The test results will be updated automatically in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
All 3 tests are passing (0 skipped), 1 test was run in 1395ms. Tests completed at 03:58:45 due to changes to StaticContentTest.class.
----

== Injection into tests

So far we have only covered integration style tests that test the app via HTTP endpoints, but what if we want to do unit testing and test our beans directly?

Quarkus supports this by allowing you to inject CDI beans into your tests via the `@Inject` annotation (in fact, tests in Quarkus are full CDI beans, so you can use all CDI functionality). Let’s create a simple test that tests the greeting service directly without using HTTP.

Create a new test class file in `src/test` in the `org.acme.people` package called `GreetingServiceTest.java`. Use the following code for the file's contents (note we've included the proper imports for you):

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people;

import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.acme.people.service.GreetingService;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;

@QuarkusTest
public class GreetingServiceTest {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger("GreetingServiceTest");

    @Inject // <1>
    GreetingService service;

    @Test
    public void testGreetingService() {
        Assertions.assertTrue(service.greeting("Quarkus").startsWith("hello Quarkus"));
    }
}
----
<1> Here we are injecting our `GreetingService` and calling it, just as our RESTful resource endpoint does in the production code.

You will see new test along with your existing tests run instantly in the terminal once again. Verify the tests are passing.

[NOTE]
====
As mentioned above Quarkus tests are actually full CDI beans, and as such you can apply CDI interceptors as you would normally. As an example, if you want a test method to run within the context of a transaction you can simply apply the `@Transactional` annotation to the method and the transaction interceptor will handle it.

In addition to this you can also create your own test stereotypes. Stereotypes can be particularly useful in large applications where you have a number of beans that perform similar functions, as it allows you to do something akin to multiple inheritance (multiple annotations) without having to repeat yourself over and over.

For example we could create a `@TransactionalQuarkusTest` if we needed to write a large number of tests that required transactional support with particular configuration. It would look like (do not copy this code anywhere!)

[source, java]
----
@QuarkusTest
@Stereotype
@Transactional
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
public @interface TransactionalQuarkusTest {
}
----

If we then apply this annotation to a test class it will act as if we had applied both the `@QuarkusTest` and `@Transactional` annotations, e.g.:

[source, java]
----
@TransactionalQuarkusTest
public class TestStereotypeTestCase {

    @Inject
    UserTransaction userTransaction;

    @Test
    public void testUserTransaction() throws Exception {
        Assertions.assertEquals(Status.STATUS_ACTIVE, userTransaction.getStatus());
    }

}
----
====

== Mock support

Quarkus supports the use of mock objects using the CDI `@Alternative` mechanism. To use this simply override the bean you wish to mock with a class in the `src/test/java` directory, and put the `@Alternative` and `@Priority(1)` annotations on the bean. Alternatively, a convenient `io.quarkus.test.Mock` stereotype annotation could be used. This built-in stereotype declares `@Alternative`, `@Priority(1)` and `@Dependent`.

Let's mock our existing `GreetingService`. Although our existing service is pretty simple, in the real world the service might have too many dependencies on external systems to be feasible to call directly.

Create a new class file in `src/test/java` in the `org.acme.people` package called `MockGreetingService.java` with the following code:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.acme.people.service.GreetingService;
import io.quarkus.test.Mock;

@Mock
@ApplicationScoped
public class MockGreetingService extends GreetingService {

    @Override
    public String greeting(String name) {
        return "hello " + name + " <<<<<<<<<< from mock greeting >>>>>>>>>>";
    }
}
----

Now modify our existing `GreetingServiceTest` class to add a log statement showing the value retrieved during the test. Modify the `testGreetingService` method to look like:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Test
    public void testGreetingService() {
        LOGGER.info("greeting: " + service.greeting("Quarkus"));
        Assertions.assertTrue(service.greeting("Quarkus").startsWith("hello Quarkus"));
    }
----

The test results of the mock will be updated automatically in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
All 4 tests are passing (0 skipped), 1 test was run in 1307ms. Tests completed at 04:02:29 due to changes to MockGreetingService.class and 1 other files.
----

Press `o` to toggle test output and press `r` to re-run the continuous testing. Then, you will see:

[source, none]
----
INFO  [GreetingServiceTest] (main) greeting: hello Quarkus <<<<<<<<<< from mock greeting >>>>>>>>>>
----

This confirms that our `MockGreetingService` is being used instead of the original `GreetingService`.

Make sure to press `p` to pause the continuous testing before you go to the next lab:

[source, none]
----
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----
