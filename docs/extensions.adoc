= Quarkus Extensions
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot^] and offers a unified imperative and reactive programming model and a number of other developer features like Live Reload to bring _real joy_ to your development.

*Red Hat* offers the fully supported https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus[Red Hat Build of Quarkus(RHBQ)^] with support and maintenance of Quarkus. In this workhop, you will use Quarkus to develop Kubernetes-native microservices and deploy them to OpenShift. Quarkus is one of the runtimes included in https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^]. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_quarkus[Learn more about RHBQ^].

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== If you've already completed the Quarkus Basic Hands-on Lab Today

*If you have completed the Basic lab today*, you can scroll/skip down to the **List Extensions** exercise to continue your Quarkus lab. If not, then continue below:

== First Step: Set Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 700]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just select the green recycle icon to reset it.

== Select-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by selecting anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by selecting */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a select!");
    }
}
----

Simply select once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by selecting"
----

## Access Your Development Environment

You will be using VS Code server based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ DS_URL }}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance^] and select *Log in with OpenShift* button:

image::login_with_openshift.png[login,800]

Type in the following credentail:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ DS_USER_PASSWORD }}`

image::che-login.png[login,800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the *Authorize Access* page as below, select *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::auth-access.png[auth-access, 800]
====

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on the *Create Workspace* dashboard. Copy the following `Git Repo URL` and select `Create & Open`.

* *Git Repo URL*: `https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/quarkus-workshop-m1m2-labs/tree/ocp-4.14`

image::ds-landing.png[ds, 800]

A new window or tab in your web browser will open automatically to showcase the progess about *Starting workspace quarkus-workshop*. It takes about *60* seconds to finish the process.

image::starting-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this information page, select `Start your workspace` to continue  using your workspace.

image::starting-workspace-info.png[ds, 800]
====

After a few seconds, you’ll be placed in the workspace.

image::ds-workspace.png[ds, 800]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see this infomation page, check on `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'projects'`. Then, select `Yes, I trust the authors.

image::ds-trust-popup.png[ds, 800]
====

You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

## Explore Project

Let's take a look at the left *Explorer*. Your Quarkus project was already imported when the workspace was created. 

When you select the `pom.xml`, you will see which version fo the Red Hat Build of Quarkus you will use for the workshop today.

image::ds-explorer.png[cdw, 900]

The project also has

* The Maven structure
* An `org.acme.people.rest.GreetingResource` resource exposed on `/hello`, along with a simple test
* A landing page that is accessible on `http://localhost:8080` after starting the application
* The application configuration file
* Other source files we'll use later

Navigate to `src -> main -> java -> org.acme.people.rest` in the project tree and double select `GreetingResource.java`.

image::initnav.png[VS Code-workspace-terminal, 800]

This class has a very simple RESTful endpoint definition:

[source, java]
----
@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

It’s a very simple REST endpoint, returning "hello" to requests on `/hello`.

[NOTE]
====
Compared to vanilla JAX-RS, with Quarkus there is no need to create an `Application` class. It’s supported but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different `*Scoped` annotations (`ApplicationScoped`, `RequestScoped`, etc).
====

## Running the Application in Live Coding Mode

**Live Coding** (also referred to as _dev mode_) allows us to run the app and make changes on the fly. Quarkus will automatically re-compile and reload the app when changes are made. This is a powerful and efficient style of developing that you will use throughout the lab.

You can always use the `mvn` (Maven) commands to run Quarkus apps, but we've created a few helpful *tasks* on the VS Code.

Navigate the *Command Palette* menu or the press kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on macOS). 

image::navigate-command-palette.png[commands, 800]

Delete `<` then type `task` in the command palette. Make sure to append a `space` character after the *task*. 

Select the `che` task to show the Quarkus tasks up.

image::type-task.png[type-task, 800]

Start the _Live Coding_ by selecting `che: 02. Start Live Coding`.

image::quarkus-tasks.png[quarkus-tasks, 800]

A terminal opens automatically to run the *Quarkus Dev Mode*.

image::cmd-livecoding.png[livecoding, 900]

This will compile and run the app using `mvn compile quarkus:dev` in a Terminal window. Leave this terminal window open throughout the lab! You will complete the entire lab without shutting down Quarkus Live Coding mode, so be careful not to close the tab (if you do, you re-run it). This is very useful for quick experimentation.

[NOTE]
====
The first time you build the app, new dependencies may be downloaded via maven. This should only happen once, after that things will go even faster
====

[NOTE]
====
You may see WARNINGs like `Unrecognized configuration key` or `Duplicate entry`. These are configuration values that will take effect later on and can be safely ignored for now.
Occasionally you may get an error (e.g. `NullPointerException`) during Live Reloading. In this case, simply close the terminal and restart live coding using the task.
====

You should see:

[source,none]
----
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) people 1.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus xx.xx.xx.) started in 2.469s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated.
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Installed features: [cdi, resteasy-reactive, smallrye-context-propagation, vertx]

--
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----

Note the amazingly fast startup time! The app is now running *locally* (within the Che container in which the workspace is also running). `localhost` refers to the Kubernetes pod, not *your* laptop (so therefore opening localhost:8080 in your browser will not do anything).

You can also see *Tests paused* by default when a Quarkus application gets started. We will learn more details in the _Testing Quarkus App_ lab.

VS Code will also detect that the Quarkus app opens port `5005` (for debugging) and `8080` (for web requests). *Close the popup not to add a port 5005*, but when prompted, *Open In New Tab* to open a port `8080`, which opens a new tab in your web browser:

image::open-port.png[port, 700]

[NOTE]
====
In case you see the popup message below, select `Open`.

image::open-external.png[port, 700]
====

You should see the default Quarkus welcome page:

image::welcome-quarkus.png[port, 900]

Open a *new* terminal by selecting `+` icon:

image::cmd-terminal.png[livecoding, 900]

and invoke the `hello` endpoint using the following _curl_ command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
----

You can also add `/hello` to the Quarkus welcome page to see the same result as the _curl_ command:

image::crw-open-page-hello.png[page, 800]

When you fail to access the *hello* page, make sure to call the URL using *http* protocol.

Now, let's exercise the **live reload** capabilities of Quarkus. In VS Code, open the `GreetingResource.java` file (in `src/main/java/org/acme/people/rest`) and change `return "hello";` to `return "hola";` in the editor. After making this change, reload the same brower tab that was showing `hello`. It should now show `hola`.

Wow, how cool is that? Supersonic Subatomic live reload! Go ahead and change it a few more times and access the endpoint again. And we're just getting started. Leave the app running so we can continue to change it on the fly in the next section.

[NOTE]
====
`quarkus:dev` runs Quarkus in development mode. This enables live reload with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.
====

[NOTE]
====
This will also listen for a debugger on port `5005`. If you want to wait for the debugger to attach before running you can pass `-Ddebug` on the command line. If you don’t want the debugger at all you can use `-Ddebug=false`. We'll use this later.
====

== In case you haven’t done Module 1 (Basic) today

If you are only doing the *Advanced* lab today, or you didn’t quite complete the Basic Lab, you'll need to login to OpenShift, then build and deploy the application needed for the exercises using a utility script provided. Follow the steps below to do this.

==== Login to OpenShift

Although your VS Code is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it's running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. So we'll log in with your workshop user. Execute the following command in the VS Code terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc login -u {{ USER_ID }} -p {{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }} https://openshift.default.svc:443
----

You should see:

[source, none]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * {{ USER_ID }}-devspaces
    {{ USER_ID }}-project

Using project "user1-devspaces".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift server via the CLI. We'll use the prettier web console later on in this lab.

=== Deploy app

Deploy the `people` microservice by executing the following shell script in a CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
sh scripts/deploy-people.sh {{ USER_ID }}
----

Wait for the script to complete before continuing.

When the script completes, the app is deployed to OpenShift. You can see it in the {{ CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Console^]. Login with your assigned username and password (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

image::ocplogin.png[login,700]

Once logged in, select the name of your project (`{{ USER_ID }}-project`):

image::ocpproj.png[project,700]

Switch to the _Developer Perspective_ using the upper-left drop-down:

image::devperspective.png[perspective, 700]

This provides a developer-centric Topology view of applications deployed to the project. You can see the single `people` deployment that we just deployed earlier using the CLI:

image::peopledc.png[project,600]

== List extensions

Ready to dive into *advanced* Quarkus development? Let's learn how easily Quarkus allows developers to extend for building a vibrant ecosystem.

Think of Quarkus extensions as your project dependencies. Extensions configure, boot and integrate a framework or technology into your Quarkus application. They also do all of the heavy lifting of providing the right information to GraalVM for your application to compile natively.

Quarkus aims to provide a support for a full https://quarkus.io/extensions/[extension ecosystem^], to make it easy to discover and consume 3rd party extensions, as well as providing easier version management.

Retrieve the list of possible extensions using the Maven plugin. Run this in the Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn quarkus:list-extensions
----

You can see the list of ~538 different extensions available to you in the output:

[source,none]
----
[INFO] Current Quarkus extensions available: 
[INFO] 
[INFO] ✬ ArtifactId                                         Extension Name

[INFO] ✬ camel-quarkus-aws2-cw                              Camel AWS 2 CloudWatch
...
----

Adding an extension is similarly easy. With Maven, you can add extensions using `mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="extension1,extension2,..."`. The extension name can be the maven groupId/artifactId name of the extension: e.g. `io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal`. But you can pass a partial name and Quarkus will do its best to find the right extension. For example, `agroal`, `Agroal` or `agro` will expand to `io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal`. If no extension is found or if more than one extensions match, you will see a warning and a list of possible matches in the command result.

When you run Quarkus applications, the list of extensions enabled are shown in the output, such as:

[source, none]
----
INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [agroal, cdi, hibernate-orm, jdbc-h2, narayana-jta, resteasy]
----

[NOTE]
====
In Live Coding mode, Quarkus will monitor the state of `pom.xml` and bring in new dependencies. No need to stop and restart!
====

== Add an extension

Later on in this lab we'll be using `Jackson` serialization support for RESTEasy Reactive, so let's add that extension here. In the Terminal, run the following command to add the _RESTEasy Reactive Jackson_ extension to your project:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="resteasy-reactive-jackson"
----

You should see
[source,console]
----
[INFO] [SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jackson has been installed
----

The result of this command is a new `<dependency>` added to our `pom.xml` which you can see by looking at the differences you've made up till now.

Select the _Source Control_ view and then select `pom.xml`:

image::gitdiff.png[login,1000]

You'll see all the changes to `pom.xml` since you started, including the new extensions we've added.

You may see other apparent differences due to whitespace and/or the re-shuffling of XML elements when you ran `mvn quarkus:add-extension`.

There are many other git and GitHub operations like this one that you can perform directly in the IDE for real projects (e.g. committing, branching, merging, push/pull, log viewing, etc).

Go back to the **Explorer** view in CodeReady (to see the tree of files once again).

== Writing your own extension

Quarkus extensions add a new developer focused behavior to the core offering, and consist of two distinct parts, buildtime augmentation and runtime container. The augmentation part is responsible for all metadata processing, such as reading annotations, XML descriptors etc. The output of this augmentation phase is recorded bytecode which is responsible for directly instantiating the relevant runtime services.

This means that metadata is only processed once at build time, which both saves on startup time, and also on memory usage as the classes etc that are used for processing are not loaded (or even present) in the runtime JVM.

Writing a Quarkus extension is beyond the scope of this lab, so consult the https://quarkus.io/guides/extension-authors-guide[Extension Author's Guide^] for more detail on writing your own extension.

== Congratulations

Quarkus aims to provide a support for a full https://quarkus.io/extensions/[extension ecosystem^], to make it easy to discover and consume 3rd party extensions, as well as providing easier version management.

We'll be adding additional extensions as we go along in other sections of this workshop.
